                    <p>I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 1st 1992. My mother says the moment she saw me I was staring at her and all around with my  big eyes. From the moment they saw me they said that I was a very curious person.</p>

                    <p>CD’s and cassettes brought magic within: The Beatles, Guns N’ Roses, Queen, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Inevitably, I got inspired.  I got my first guitar for my 12th birthday. It was either that or a school trip. I reckon I decided well. Now it was time to start to    unblock Rock riffs and songs.</p>

                    <p>I was lucky to form great bands with friends from school and my music institute. Nirmods, Awoodstock, Full Throttle, the Warhols. Funny  and happy times. But also courageous, playing at Parque de la Costa, Doors, Marin, Canal 7, and more.</p>

                    <p>My first album is loaded with emotion. I can’t express entirely the joy of producing with friends. Stories, fictions and personal    experiences mark this album. Powerful emotions are present, they had to be sang out loud.</p>

                    <p>I couldn’t cut the flow of music. And I didn’t want it to. So just before going to Denmark I rushed to record a double album. It was     also stirring: I was leaving home to embark on a new adventure. “Before North” is energetic and mystical. You might be carried away easily  by the thread of the album.</p>
